# rangeAlgorithms
Implementing  the  Range  algorithms  from  slides 3,4,5  in  the  ppt  04-algorithm-analysis  on  canvas.  In  the implementation,  trying  the  different  values  of  N  as  given  in  slide  6.  On  personal  computer the runtime will vary. Reporting the runtimes in plots.  
Submission: Please put your code up on github and share it with us. You should include a  readme and also a pdf that outlines your runtime analysis.

Analysis Structure
In order to analyze and record appropraite data, I would attempt to minimize potential differences among the processor loads during different algorithms' testing, that could be experienced due to a variation at the amount of external applications being ran during various testing trials. In accordance with the presented range values, following n-calues may be utilized:
1000
2000
4000
8000
16000
32000
64000
128000
256000
512000
1e6
2e6
4e6
8e6
1.67e7
3.3e7
6.5e7
1.3e8
2.6e8
